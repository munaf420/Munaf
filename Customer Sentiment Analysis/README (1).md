# Customer Review Sentiment Analysis



## Overview
This project uses Python to do sentiment analysis on a collection of customer reviews. The text data must first be cleaned and tokenized as part of the preparation step. Sentiment analysis is then used to categorise the comments as neutral, negative, or positive. Word frequency analysis is used to identify major themes in both positive and negative feedback, and visualisation is used to summarise the overall sentiment distribution. The project's goal is to learn more about how customers feel about items based on their evaluations in order to better understand customer preferences and areas where the company can make improvements.
